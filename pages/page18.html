        <p>The image depicts a fragment of a spacecraft soaring through the starry night sky.</p>
        <p>This card represents hope and vision, purification, and tranquility, projecting the inner aspirations that focus on both the material and spiritual aspects of human life. While having hope may not necessarily solve practical problems, any solution to problems must begin with hope. Without it, people cannot achieve anything. The Star signifies freedom, not in terms of wealth or physical freedom, but a spiritual freedom where one holds their beliefs and can pursue what they desire. The card guides along a path leading directly to the subconscious. In contrast to the High Priestess, who is separated from the pool by a veil, in the Star card, this separation disappears.</p>
        <p>The Star represents longing and hope. However, it is essential to note that the feelings brought by the Star, while pleasant, may not be stable. Its key term is "hope," and although the Star is beautiful, it rarely points to real situations. Instead, it is more related to the psychological state of the querent, indicating that they are in a state of hopefulness, believing that things will have positive outcomes. Due to the lack of material and realistic measurements, this pure joy and pleasure may stem from spiritual awakening but are more likely due to ignorance or prolonged suppression. This state often occurs when the querent begins something and, lacking awareness of the future challenges, indulges in optimistic fantasies. Prolonged suppression refers to an individual becoming unexpectedly optimistic after experiencing significant difficulties and suffering. This illusion-like optimistic state is a manifestation of psychological stress reactions. If it is something illusory, it cannot last. The querent will quickly return to reality, and without sufficient preparation, they may soon experience the harshness of reality. The Star card has both positive and negative meanings. On the positive side, it includes returning to one's true self and seeking inner peace and joy. On the negative side, it may represent blind optimism, a joyful state without thoughtful consideration, only based on the belief that surviving a disaster leads to good fortune. Additionally, it is a somewhat "airy" card, lacking a foundation and being distant from elements like material security and stability.</p>
        <p>The development from the Hubble Space Telescope to the James Webb Space Telescope marks a significant advancement in astronomical observation technology. Launched in April 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope is an orbiting space telescope with exceptional field of view and resolution. By avoiding the atmospheric interference, the Hubble telescope provides clear and precise astronomical images. Its operation has led to extensive research into the universe, offering scientists valuable data.</p>
        <p>With technological progress, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has emerged as the successor to the Hubble. The JWST is a more advanced telescope designed for observations in the infrared spectrum, featuring a larger mirror and enhanced observational capabilities. The design of the JWST aims to further expand our understanding of the universe by exploring more information about galaxy formation, planetary atmospheres, and the origins of the cosmos.</p>
        <p>Stargazing apps and websites enable individuals to engage in astronomical observations from anywhere at any time using mobile devices or computers. By integrating astronomical databases, real-time observation data, and advanced simulation techniques, these applications and websites provide star maps, celestial object positions, planet motion predictions, and other relevant information. Users can utilize these tools to identify and observe celestial objects, learn about astronomy, or track astronomical events.</p>
        <p>The operation of stargazing apps and websites relies on the collection and processing of astronomical data. They access real-time observation data from satellites and ground-based telescopes, combine this data with astronomical databases, and present it to users through user-friendly interfaces. This allows ordinary people to participate in the joy of astronomy, gaining deeper insights into the mysteries of the universe.</p>
