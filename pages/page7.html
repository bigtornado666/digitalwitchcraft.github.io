        <p>Two affectionate computers hold hands, floating in the air. Below, in the desert, there is a winding and lengthy road that resembles a narrow river. In the sky above, at an unseen location, there is also a giant computer screen observing them.</p>
        <p>The Lovers card is the 6th card in the Tarot deck. The number 6 carries the meaning of achieving balance and mutual cooperation in all things. Coupled with the Lovers card and the element of air, it represents achieving good and balanced relationships in various aspects such as work, love, friendship, and family. This configuration is ideal without being too rigid, allowing for mutual assistance with everyone in the same group, which is why the Lovers card likes to try various options without causing chaos from the nature of the air element.</p>
        <p>In Chinese Taoism, there is an ancient saying - harmonizing Yin and Yang. The Lovers card represents the harmonization of Yin and Yang: the union of lovers, the harmony of reason and passion. In modern interpretation, the most important theme of the Lovers card is the choices and decisions made for the sake of love.</p>
        <p>Online dating apps and websites were evidently no longer sufficient to meet human needs. Humans had developed more ways of romantic engagement, such as uploading their digital avatars to the metaverse and chatting in virtual reality. Alternatively, people may engage in romantic relationships with virtual characters in electronic games.</p>
