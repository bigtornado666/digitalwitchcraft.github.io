        <p>The Strength card is the next card after the Chariot card. While the Fool controls conflicting emotions within themselves powerfully in the Chariot, in the Strength card, the Fool recognizes that there are some emotions that can never be completely uprooted from the inner self. Dealing with them using the Chariot's approach is not necessarily successful; instead, it might make one very uncomfortable. Desires and fears, for example, can only be pruned but not completely eradicated. Therefore, the Fool begins to confront these deep-seated negative emotions with inner wisdom and resilience. By making the inner self gradually complete, these negative emotions are no longer a "threat." The mindset of the Fool in the Chariot card and the Strength card is entirely different. The Fool in the Chariot is prone to a sense of frustration and restlessness due to the accumulation of negative emotions, while the Fool in the Strength card calmly faces them with wisdom and inner strength. This is a form of catharsis, rather than coercion seen in the Chariot.</p>
        <p>There were various trendy challenges frequently emerge on the internet, such as the Ice Bucket Challenge, to promote awareness about ALS and provide assistance and encouragement to patients. These activities emphasize the importance of overcoming difficulties and maintaining perseverance. Through the dissemination on social media, they contribute to the formation of a collective culture of resilience.</p>
