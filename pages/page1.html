        <p>A huge computerized spacecraft hovers in the air, seemingly descending slowly. One of the few surviving members of the human beings walks across the vast, boundless desert. Where did they come from? What happened to the human world? Where are they heading to? The appearance of this spacecraft with a computer-like exterior raises questions about its significance. Everything is unknown, much like the Fool card—it marks the beginning of a completely new journey.</p>
        <p>In the ancient Wisconti-Sforza Tarot deck, the Fool card looks quite different from the Fool in 20th-century's Tarot decks. The young jester on the Fool card has several feathers stuck in his hair, and his breeches are pulled down to his knees. This Fool from ancient times appears rather foolish—he looks like a country bumpkin, lacking any dignity. However, during the Renaissance period in Europe, this Fool became an important symbol of the Christian Carnival. The seven chicken feathers on his head and the shabby bag indicate his poverty. He is not a court jester but a symbol of the common poor, reminding us that external worldly possessions are not everything; it's what we hold in our hearts that truly matters. The prototype of the Fool character comes from the Roman festival of Saturnalia, where people would dress up as characters from the major arcana and parade through the streets. The Fool would run around playfully, mocking these characters. This is also one of the reasons why the Fool card doesn't have a specific number, as he doesn't have a fixed position in this procession. Over time, the Fool has evolved and now plays the role of the Joker in standard fifty-two-card playing decks.</p>
        <p>The Fool is unrestrained, filled with a spirit of adventure, and holds infinite possibilities. Their innocence and naive thoughts bring new perspectives to many things. The Fool doesn’t care about societal judgments, exuding an admirable self-confidence. Talented, yet uninterested in the pursuit of fame and fortune, the Fool doesn't bother with gains or losses, honors or disgraces. Without attachments, perhaps their thoughts have transcended our understanding, making it challenging to make hasty judgments, but he is also hesitant to act recklessly.</p>   
        <p>The Fool symbolizes the great effort driven by dreams, where the opinions of others seem less important. However, this card can, at times, indicate situations of being out of touch, overly exaggerated, blindly escaping reality, or avoiding facing the truth.</p>
        <p>No one knows where the Fool comes from, yet no one knows where the Fool is headed. They represent an unknown emerging phenomenon, blending an unknown world with the known world.</p>
        <p>In the case of digital witchcraft on the internet, emerging phenomena such as digital interactive technologies would no longer surprise humanity pre-apocalypse. People of that time excelled in studying perceptual computing, aiming for computers to perceive and understand their surroundings and make intelligent decisions. The efforts to advance this field aimed to enhance computers' perceptual abilities towards users and the environment, making interactions more natural, intelligent, and adaptive. People had become inseparable from computers, increasingly yearning for machines that could perceive the world as humans do.</p>
        <p>For instance, in sensor technology, devices like cameras, microphones, accelerometers, and gyroscopes can all function as sensors. These sensors are capable of capturing physical information from the environment, such as images, sound, motion, and more. Common applications like facial recognition and gesture recognition stem from computer vision technology, enabling computers to comprehend and interpret images and videos. Through these processes, computers can identify objects, faces, movements, and more. Motion sensing is also prevalent, playing a crucial role in applications like virtual reality, interactive gaming, and health monitoring.</p>
        <p>As humans trained computers to understand various methods of perceiving the world, when humans cease to exist but computers endure, these machines, armed with their trained memories, could potentially become the highest intelligence on Earth.</p>
