        <p>The image shows a bunch of dead computers sitting in the desert, waiting for the final judgment. On the sky there's a lead computer, whose screen shows some codes. Are those the record of each computer's life stories?</p>
        <p>The Judgment card represents significant transformations, awakening, and a profound contemplation of life. This card conveys themes of renewal and rebirth, marking the end of a previous phase and opening the door to a new stage of life and experiences. In the traditional Rider-Waite Tarot, the Judgment card depicts a scene of a large angel blowing a trumpet, awakening the dead, symbolizing an individual's introspection and reassessment of life. The Judgment card also signifies liberation from past constraints, breaking free from old patterns and limitations, while being connected to concepts of forgiveness and acceptance. It is a card that revolves around spiritual justice and soul growth, emphasizing a transcendent understanding of justice and morality beyond the material realm. The trumpet blown by the angel is a symbol of awakening, calling individuals to delve into their inner selves and gain new insights into life goals and directions. The Judgment card provides profound insights, bringing inner and outer transformations to individuals.</p>
        <p>Ancient Indo-European myths about the apocalypse and the final judgment underwent significant changes from the Mithraic and ascetic traditions to Christianity. They transitioned from promoting the continuous cycle of destruction and rebirth to a linear and static worldview. The emphasis shifted from multiple apocalyptic events to a singular end of the world, followed by either eternal bliss or eternal torment, with no new creation.</p>
        <p>The pure forms of the original Indo-European myths were preserved in the Nordic countries. Even after the Christianization of the Roman world, the Norse maintained pagan beliefs for a millennium. The revelations created by Norse monks were considered superior to the false revelations of the New Testament's John (as false names were common in Christian practices). The prophetic tales by priestesses described future disasters, wars during the apocalypse, the voyage of the death ship, falling stars, and a great flood destroying the world. The "Twilight of the Gods" was not announced by a great angel but by the god Heimdall, who blew the final trumpet.</p>
        <P>Heimdall, a god of three races, resulted from his marriages with the triple earth goddesses: great-grandmother Edda, grandmother Amma, and mother Modir. Born of the union with the Nine Waves Sea Goddesses, Heimdall was sent ashore by the ninth wave, "born in ancient times, immensely strong, of the race of the gods, born of the nine giant daughters at the edge of the earth... strong with the power of the earth, cold sea, and bear's blood."</P>
        <p>Heimdall's divine race is known as the Aesir. His name means "son of the ocean goddess," similar to the title of the Dalai Lama. The apocalypse he proclaims is also known as "Twilight of the Gods" (Gotterdammerung), sometimes erroneously translated as "Twilight of the Gods." The term refers to an entity that devours the gods, known as Skadi, a goddess derived from the Germanic and Old English words for "shadow." Skadi, or the Destroyer, akin to Kali, absorbs the universe, swallowing the gods, as they become corrupt, brutal, abuse their power, teach humans to do wrong. Thus, the goddess curses the gods and reclaims the universe into her infinite darkness.</p>
        <p>In this narrative, Skadi declares the "Mother's Spell" (Mutspell), cursing the world and belligerent deities. Summoning evil spirits from her abode in the "Southern Hot Land," referred to as Mutspellheim by the Vikings.</p>
        <p>These traditional beliefs, migrating with early Aryan people from southeast to northwest, across the entire Eurasian continent, suggest that the concept of the apocalypse predates both Mithraism and Christianity. It originates from the religion of the Black Kali, who punishes the gods and humanity for ignoring her teachings of love, peace, and unity, choosing instead to fight among themselves, destroying family and religious ties, harming women and children, and engaging in theft, robbery, and murder. Ancient people believed that the wrathful goddess would not sustain the universe for such evil beings, making the inevitable apocalypse and Skadi's devouring of all creation unavoidable. She would consume everything: "white, yellow, and all colors will disappear into the black, just like that... everything will enter into Kali's body."</p>
        <p>Indian sages explained that after the dissolution of all things, Kali would emerge from the "dark formless" face, existing alone, "indescribable and unimaginable," until the opportune moment when she would utter the original syllable "Aum" and recreate the world.</p>
        <p>Thus, the Tarot Judgment card's angel might not represent Michael or Gabriel but Heimdall or a deity from esoteric traditions, proclaiming the destruction of the entire world, except for those chosen by the mother goddess—the seeds of the next world, who escape on Manu's ark. In the Tarot system, those who escape are symbolically voyaging towards the final trump card, the naked female goddess. This revelation is not Christian; instead, the card in the Major Arcana implies a female-dominant, cyclical universe. Therefore, the Judgment card might not depict God judging humanity but the mother goddess judging the gods.</p>
        <p>This card is also known as the "Rebirth of the Self," not referring to Christian bodily resurrection but to the new life within, understanding the final lesson of the Major Arcana—not about heaven but a worldly lesson: "the world."</p>
