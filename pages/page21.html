        <p>The image shows a bunch of dead computers sitting in the desert, waiting for the final judgment. On the sky there's a lead computer, whose screen shows some codes. Are those the record of each computer's life stories?</p>
        <p>The Judgment card represents significant transformations, awakening, and a profound contemplation of life. This card conveys themes of renewal and rebirth, marking the end of a previous phase and opening the door to a new stage of life and experiences. In the traditional Rider-Waite Tarot, the Judgment card depicts a scene of a large angel blowing a trumpet, awakening the dead, symbolizing an individual's introspection and reassessment of life. The Judgment card also signifies liberation from past constraints, breaking free from old patterns and limitations, while being connected to concepts of forgiveness and acceptance. It is a card that revolves around spiritual justice and soul growth, emphasizing a transcendent understanding of justice and morality beyond the material realm. The trumpet blown by the angel is a symbol of awakening, calling individuals to delve into their inner selves and gain new insights into life goals and directions. The Judgment card provides profound insights, bringing inner and outer transformations to individuals.</p>
