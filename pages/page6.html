        <p>This image shows a computer trying to channel to the main guiding center, which can provide spiritual guidance, and represent tradition and structured belief systems. On the computer's screen, there is a beautiful ocean, representing holy belief and hope.</p>
        <p>The Hierophant in the Tarot is a particularly mysterious figure, and it absolutely does not refer to the traditional Christian Pope. While some scholars view him as the Roman Pope, they still have reservations. The interpretation of the Hierophant card typically implies that those seeking the truth should look deeper. In classical Tarot decks, the pillars behind the Hierophant are not supporting anything, which carries symbolic significance.</p>
        <p>From a numerical perspective, the 5 of the Hierophant corresponds to the 15th Devil card. In the 13th century, the Cathars believed that the God of the Roman Church was the devil, creating this world as a trap to capture souls. This card also has alternative depictions, portraying the pagan deities called "devils" by the Church. Some French Tarot decks use "Jupiter" instead of the Hierophant to match with the "Juno" of the High Priestess. In some decks, "Bacchus" replaces the Hierophant, depicted seated on a wine barrel, drinking from a bottle. In medieval Europe, people widely worshiped Bacchus, and even today, Italian peasants swear by his name. In their language, Bacchus' body is equivalent to God's body. In the 19th century, German winemakers continued to set up altars for Bacchus on the Rhine islands, making predictions about the harvest.</p>
        <p>The Hierophant in the Tarot also goes by other names, such as "The High Priest" or "The Gypsy Prince," all related to magic. Historically, some popes were considered masters of black magic. In Leo III's "Book of Horus," in addition to magical spells, there were seventy-two secret names of God that magicians could use to practice magic. Many believed that the Pope's power relied on these hidden names. This belief originated from ancient name magic and later evolved into the doctrine of sacred phrases in Christianity.</p>
        <p>Long before Christianity, the concept of the power of language existed, and it was widespread in most mystical religions. At the gates of heaven, a high monk holding the keys was a common symbol, and the Mithraic religion also had a high bishop, known as the "Father of Fathers," who held the keys to heaven and hell. The Pope in Christianity inherited both the keys and the title from him. "PATRI" later evolved into "PAPA", and later into "POPE". (Peter's name also changed due to the transformation of the title). If we delve into the legend of Roman Peter, we will find a strange myth. Several centuries before the rise of Christianity, there was a Peter in charge of the afterlife. Later, Christian mythology claimed that Saint Peter's inverted cross stood on a mountain in the Vatican. This ancient stone column can also be seen elsewhere. The inverted cross of Peter may have evolved from PETRA of the Father, and the inverted PETRA is the bridge between heaven and earth.</p>
        <p>In pagan terms, the Pope is the "image of God," just like ancient high monks. What's more interesting is that some modern Tarot cards will replace "The Hierophant" with "The High Priest."</p>
        <p>And some traditional Tarot cards associate "The Hierophant" with "The Devil," possibly based on legends that some Roman Popes made pacts with the devil to obtain their holy office. The position of the Pope was determined by the devil, and the medieval people apparently saw no contradiction. Hence, the notion emerged: "If someone wants to study the works of God, the first step is to collaborate with the devil."
        <p>The modern interpretation of the Hierophant card in Tarot often intertwines with beliefs and mysterious, noble forces. There was a growing phenomenon of superstition around memes. Memes, which were images, videos, or texts spread through the internet, often express viewpoints in a humorous, ironic, or unique way. Some individuals started to believe that specific memes contain good luck, happiness, or positive energy. For instance, memes featuring lucky symbols, animals, or jokes were thought to bring good fortune, leading people to share and repost them to attract luck.</p>
        <p>This superstition may be linked to people's desire to find emotional solace and comfort in the digital age. Faced with the stresses and uncertainties of everyday life, individuals found various ways to gain strength and a sense of well-being. Memes, as a form of lighthearted entertainment, had been endowed with mysterious and supernatural attributes. This phenomenon also reflected people's reliance on internet culture and virtual social media platforms, as well as the tendency to attribute special meaning to random events and coincidences.</p>
