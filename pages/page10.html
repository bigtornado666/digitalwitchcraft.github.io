        <p>The Hermit card here takes on the role of a prophet. In traditional Rider-Waite Tarot, the robed figure of the Hermit embodies the energy of a seer, often cautioning people about the need for solitude for introspection. The Hermit illuminates the dim surroundings with the light in his hand, allowing him to see the subtle aspects of life. The Hermit represents a temporary departure from the external world to awaken the inner self and listen to one's own inner voice. This process requires maintaining silence, being still like water, undisturbed by external influences, emphasizing the crystallization of intelligence and absolute discipline. It is also a card representing inner success, maturity, hinting at the end of a cycle where you need to personally experience certain things, following the guidance of a higher self.</p>
        <p>Many games in human society have incorporated the element of lighthouses, which often symbolize guidance. In the final chapter of "Life is Strange: Before the Storm," Max must follow the lighthouse's beam of light to escape a recurring nightmare, progressing towards the lighthouse. Simultaneously, the lighthouse serves as a guide for her to gain strength and make crucial decisions. In "Alan Wake" and its sequel, Alan Wake and Saga Andersen, frequently rely on the light from a lighthouse during their exploration in the wilderness of Bright Falls. Lighthouses can be designed as markers guiding players forward. In open-world games, they signify important locations, guiding players to explore new areas. In maze or adventure games, lighthouses may be the key for players to find exits or objectives.</p>
