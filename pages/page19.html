        <p>A computer sits alone in the desert, and beside it, there seems to be a moon floating in an oasis water source. Or is it just the reflection of the moon in the sky?</p>
        <p>The Moon confronts conflicts and contradictions in the subconscious, liberating oneself but forgetting that life should be carefree.</p>
        <p>However, where there is light, there is darkness. The appearance of the Moon signifies your anxiety, confusion, and fear. If you wait for the sun to rise naturally, it will be too late. So, what you need to do is listen to your "dreams," your subconscious, find the root cause, and resolve it to bring inner peace. The Moon card wants to convey that you shouldn't care about others' opinions, express yourself freely, and explore the desires within.</p>
        <p>The Moon represents our subconscious, inner emotions, those hidden and sensitive aspects, always hiding behind the sun (consciousness) and reflecting its light. When interpreting the Tarot, these are still key aspects of the Moon. Impressions associated with the Moon include its orbit around the Earth, the changing phases, and its influence on tides. Therefore, in Tarot, the Moon can also be understood as accommodating external influences, weak autonomous consciousness (orbiting the Earth), cyclical phenomena such as relationships, careers, moods, and even life itself (phases), and the interplay between the subconscious and conscious, emotions, and actions (tides). In summary, the Moon represents our suppressed side, the moments when we choose to quietly wait without making changes. However, this quietude is not entirely passive, as it signifies our belief in the cycles and fluctuations of life, trusting that time will resolve all issues.</p>
        <p>In instances of online subconscious hypnosis, individuals seek to influence the subconscious states of others through various forms of internet media, such as ASMR videos, online meditation audios, virtual reality experiences, and online hypnotherapy sessions. ASMR videos simulate specific sounds or tactile sensations to induce a pleasurable response in the audience, believed to have potential hypnotic effects. Online meditation and relaxation audios offer sound guidance for meditation, self-hypnosis, and deep relaxation, using language and sound effects to shape subconscious states. Virtual reality experiences impact users' subconscious through images, sounds, and interactive elements, creating environments conducive to relaxation or meditation. Additionally, some professional hypnotherapists provide hypnotherapy services through online platforms, guiding patients into a deep hypnotic state via video conferencing or audio recordings to facilitate therapeutic and mental health benefits.</p>
