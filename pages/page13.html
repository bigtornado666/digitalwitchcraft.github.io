        <p>The image shows that A computer is hanging upside down in the sky, suspended by power cords. Below, there is a barren desert, but amidst it, a small oasis with a serene blue lake.</p>
        <p>The Hanged Man can be seen as a card representing "surrender," implying that by submitting to life during this period and letting it lead you where you need to go, you can benefit greatly. It is also an independent card, accepting it based on your own feelings. Even if others think your approach is peculiar, it represents a moment of inner calm after experiencing a challenging time, something only you can truly understand.</p>
        <p>During this time, there's no need to struggle; instead, take the opportunity to reflect on past actions, the current situation, and future plans. The present is just a temporary state, like pressing the "pause button" in life. Use this time to reevaluate everything that has happened in your life.</p>
        <p>In astrology, The Hanged Man corresponds to the water element. Similar to the qualities displayed by water, a path forward doesn't involve going backward. It embodies the trait of yielding without resistance, and even in doing so, it can achieve unity with tremendous power. It also corresponds to the voluntarily sacrificial and idealistic Neptune. While significant changes may not happen immediately, your waiting, accumulation, and sacrifices will eventually converge like a "river," carving out your own path.</p>
        <p>In divination, The Hanged Man carries the significance of sacrifice, but it is not forced; rather, it is voluntary. The figure appears calm and relaxed, not struggling or resisting, as they understand that appropriate sacrifice and pause can bring more valuable rewards.</p>
        <p>Due to the increasing reliance on social networks in human interactions, a phenomenon known as social media self-censorship has emerged. This involves individuals reviewing and adjusting their content before posting to avoid negative feedback and controversies on social media platforms. It reflects individuals' concerns about potential online harassment and disputes, as they strive to maintain a positive image and reputation on social media. Self-censorship often manifests as avoiding sensitive topics, seeking social approval, evading controversies, and limiting the genuine expression of opinions on social media. While it helps mitigate negative impacts, it also raises concerns about freedom of speech and diversity of expression.</p>
