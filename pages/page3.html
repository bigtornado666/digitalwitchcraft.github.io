        <p>A computer sits silently within a large bookcase, its shelves crammed with an assortment of books. Resembling both a mirror, reflecting a tranquil and profound river alongside towering mountains, and a window beckoning onlookers to venture into this mysterious realm, the computer serves as a portal to the unknown. The open books on the floor appear to be whispering secrets, leaving one to wonder: where exactly does the answer lie?</p>


        <p>In Christianity, the most challenging card to accept is the High Priestess because the hierarchy believes authority belongs exclusively to men. However, in the early development of Christianity, the orthodox church omitted several Gospel chapters. These deleted passages suggest that the first pope was not Peter but Mary, the beloved of Jesus, who inherited authority directly from him. Jesus referred to Mary as the "disciple among disciples" and the "all-knowing woman," entrusting her with the keys to the kingdom. Peter, angered by this, attempted to extract secrets from Mary.</p>
        <p>Mary, labeled the High Priestess, derives her title from the ancient Indian name for the moon goddess, Ama (almah). The Hebrew term (almah) also translates to "virgin" or "maiden." The Roman Alma signifies a sacred woman associated with the moon. Plutarch regarded the moon as the source of all reason and wisdom. In Gnostic traditions, there is a moon goddess resembling the High Priestess, seated before a temple curtain, wearing the papal tiara adorned with moon symbols.</p>
        <p>In the Tarot, the High Priestess is closely linked to the Moon card, numbered 18. In the Wheel of Fortune, Card 2, the High Priestess also shares a connection with the Moon card. In Christianity, the authority of women in spiritual matters persisted until the thirteenth century but was eventually absorbed by monks. The ancient titles for prioresses were "spiritual mother," "senior nun," or "matron," holding political and spiritual autonomy over monks and nuns. Prioresses were esteemed educators, but Trent Church decreed that nunneries surrender property and authority to monasteries, forbidding new nunneries. Isolated, these nuns lost educational opportunities.</p>
        <p>Church history was continually revised to eliminate names of high-ranking women. Even in the sixteenth century, church historians believed in at least one female pope, often named Joan, who, due to her extensive knowledge, attained the position of cardinal and later pope. The Tarot card of the High Priestess is sometimes referred to as "Pope Joan" because the crown she wears resembles ancient depictions of Pope Joan. In Siena Cathedral, portraits of popes include one labeled "Pope John III, Englishwoman."</p>
        <p>The first record of Joan came from library scholar Anastasius. Scuto's Papal Chronicle noted in 854, "Joan, a woman, occupied the seat after Leo, ruling for two years, five months, and four days." Kembru's tenth-century Chronicle mentioned, "It is rumored that this Joan was a woman, involved in an affair with a servant, becoming pregnant and giving birth." Thomas de Elm's official papal registry in 1422 stated a similar reason: "Joan, a woman, not counted as a pope."</p>
        <p>Vatican Library scholar Pratina, in his book "The Life of the Popes," mentioned, "Joan, a woman, was well-read, disguised as a man until labor pains exposed her identity. She died on a street between the Lateran Palace and St. Clemen's Church." Martin said, "She is buried on that street. Popes avoid it after her death due to the horrible scene when she was stoned by the public for her gender, leaving her unmarked grave. Popes avoid this street for fear of Joan's posthumous vengeance." Joan as pope is the only eradicated part of recorded history, as the church now claims Pope Joan is a mere legend, admitting, at most, that there was a false Pope John elected by the people without papal consent.</p>
        <p>Apart from these historical events, many factors led to the creation of the High Priestess in the Tarot, and this card has consistently remained in the Major Arcana. Sometimes, the High Priestess is referred to as the "wise woman" or "Sophia," meaning wisdom in Greek. Sophia is associated with the moon in alchemical texts. She once confessed to male deities, "Without my power, you can do nothing, just like a rooster without a hen is helpless."</p>
        <p>Some medieval mystics regarded her as the pure Trinity: Creator, Uniter, and Ruler. Thus, the Magician guides the Fool, the uninformed one, first encountering the High Priestess, who imparts the spirit of feminine wisdom. Without feminine wisdom, God would be ineffectual.</p>
        <p>The High Priestess card represents a calm, feminine, and gentle power, symbolizing books, knowledge, intuition, and inner answers. The High Priestess seems to weave a serene dream, as if she will reveal the answers in the dream, yet the truth is what you have already known all along. In the phenomenon of digital witchcraft on the internet, digital education is no longer a novelty. In humanity's final stages of development, people passionately embrace the use of virtual reality technology to create an immersive learning environment.</p>
        <p>For instance, the Virtual Underwater World Science Museum, based on CAVE (Cave Automatic Virtual Environment), creates an engaging scientific educational experience. This multi-faceted stereoscopic display system utilizes high-resolution virtual topography and underwater ecosystem models to present a lifelike underwater landscape, including coral reefs, underwater caves, and various marine organisms. Users interact with the virtual environment through gestures, controllers, or body movements, enabling them to touch marine life, explore underwater terrain, and participate in virtual diving activities. Vivid displays of biodiversity and informative commentary, provided through voice guidance or textual information, offer users scientific knowledge related to the exhibits, emphasizing the importance of marine ecosystems and the need to protect the oceans. An immersive sound system simulates the underwater environment's sounds, while real-time dynamic simulation technology allows users to experience changes in the underwater ecosystem under different times and conditions. Supporting multi-user interaction enables students, families, or groups of friends to explore the virtual underwater world together, fostering collaborative learning and scientific communication. This virtual educational experience holds unique value in inspiring interest and understanding in marine science.</p>
