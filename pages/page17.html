        <p>The image shows that in the dessert, a stack of computers, piled high, has exploded. Their screens are shattered, glass shards flying in all directions, surrounded by dust. Amidst the chaotic broken screens, a heap of data is flying out, descending towards the ground.</p>
        <p>In the Tarot's 22 Major Arcana cards, when connected, they form a journey where the Fool, an unknowing individual, continuously refines their path.</p>
        <p>The Tower card, numbered sixteen, comes after the Devil card at fifteen, marking the journey from the Devil to the Tower. It represents a journey where you must release yourself from the Devil and embark on a quest for "redemption." Naturally, this can be painful, involving facing one's "mistakes," acknowledging wrongdoing, often in a controlled, almost "catastrophic" manner that is challenging to accept.</p>
        <p>Astrologically, the Tower corresponds to the highly destructive Mars, and coupled with the sudden lightning, it signifies the primary significance of the Tower—radical change, an unforeseeable shift beyond human control, delving deep into the inner self.</p>
        <p>When the Tower appears, it signifies a moment of change. At this point, you have no choice and no time to prepare for your transformation. The only thing to do is to discard the "old" and make room for the new.</p>
        <p>One of the cornerstones of human digitized life lies in the convenient supply of electricity and WiFi. Electricity provides continuous power to people's devices, while WiFi connections enable the spread and sharing of information globally. However, once a power outage or WiFi signal instability occurs, it can lead to a significant breakdown in digital life. In such situations, electronic devices cannot function properly, individuals are disconnected from the network, unable to access the internet, engage in online communication, and even routine work and leisure activities are adversely affected.</p>
