        <p>The image shows two computers tangled by cords and there's another computer that is controlling the other two computers.</p>
        <p>1 plus 5 equals 6, implying the meaning of the Lovers card. Therefore, there is often a comparison between the Devil and the Lovers card, implying the meaning of the Lovers card. However, the relaxed and fresh atmosphere of the Lovers card is no longer present here. Instead, it is replaced by the self of 1 and the leadership desire of 5. When your concern shifts from everything about the other person to how to satisfy more inner desires, this relationship becomes a cage and shackles for the other person, restraining them.</p>
        <p>In astrological terms, the Devil corresponds to the sign of Capricorn. In the Devil card, Capricorn needs to transcend the material world and accept spiritual and intellectual challenges. It requires having a purpose on a spiritual level. If this is denied, it will limit your choices and opportunities for a lifetime. Capricorn understands and masters this lesson, is dissatisfied with the status quo, makes choices beyond the material world, liberates oneself, and releases energy. They will help those who are similarly imprisoned in the dark world, lost in themselves, unable to self-rescue, relying on the positive energy given by Capricorn to overcome fear and move forward together toward common goals.</p>
        <p>The Devil represents any spiritual purpose and ideals. Pursuing them alone in the narrow material world will bring negative emotions and, ultimately, despair. Even if you can control yourself and influence those around you, at the end of your life, when everything you have done and the results of your efforts are beyond your control, everything becomes elusive and illusory. These material and damaged goals have no meaningful existence; they are just a reflection of your inner vanity.</p>
        <p>If your body is bound, it may still be untied. But if you are spiritually bound, they may not notice it, and even if they do, they have to find out the cause of the event before they can help you get freedom. To free someone from their limited beliefs is much more complicated than freeing their body because beliefs are invisible. Only the consequences they produce can prove their existence, and even if others can help you, whether you are willing to break free from the constraints will ultimately be your own choice, and you must bear the consequences, unlocking the haze in your heart, peeling it away layer by layer, to truly liberate yourself and release energy.</p>
        <p>In the digital era, a series of phenomena related to control emerged, attracting widespread attention. Firstly, some national governments implement information control by reviewing, filtering, or blocking internet content, potentially restricting discussions on politically sensitive topics, blocking specific websites, or limiting coverage of protest activities. Secondly, social media and internet platforms use personalized algorithms, but this may lead to excessive information filtering and the formation of information echo chambers, manipulating users' perspectives through algorithmic control. Additionally, with the widespread collection and utilization of personal data, privacy concerns become a facet of internet control, with users fearing a loss of control over their personal information. Internet censorship is implemented in some countries, especially during periods of political or social turmoil, leading to comprehensive internet blocks or restrictions on specific applications and websites. False information and rumors spread widely on the internet, potentially being intentional information manipulation to influence public opinions by disseminating false information. Lastly, the popularity of social media facilitates broader information dissemination but may also result in the excessive distortion or misuse of information, as social media platform designs and algorithms to some extent control user behavior. These phenomena highlight the dual nature of the power of the internet, both liberating information and potentially leading to inappropriate control of information. Therefore, societal awareness and discussions on balancing these issues are crucial to ensure that the internet promotes openness, freedom, and democracy without abusing power.</p>
