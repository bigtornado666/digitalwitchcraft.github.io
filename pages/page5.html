        <p>A dignified computer sits upright in a luxurious yet worn office chair, placed in the desolation of an uninhabited and barren desert. What is it doing? You can tell someone had sat on this chair and did some important work using this computer.</p>
        <p>The Emperor card is the 4th card, and the number 4 can form the simplest tetrahedron, making it a symbol of fundamental stability and strong internal capabilities. It represents the desire to protect, stabilize foundations, or strategically plan one's sphere of influence.</p>
        <p>The Emperor is typically seated on a stone throne, symbolizing practicality in the real world, reflecting resolute direction and a strong sense of mission in action. The orange mountain in the background implies unwavering beliefs and willpower. As this card often signifies strict laws and regulations, it aligns with the emergence of network governance in the era of big data.</p>
        <p>Network governance involves a range of measures aimed at standardizing and managing information and behavior on the internet. This regulatory landscape is diverse and includes speech censorship implemented by some countries, restrictions on specific websites or social media content, as well as measures to counter online fraud. Additionally, data protection laws are established to ensure the safeguarding of data privacy on the internet. Some countries enact legislation to uphold freedom of speech, protecting citizens' speech rights online. Platforms themselves conduct content moderation, removing inappropriate content to ensure community safety and compliance. Furthermore, to counteract online terrorism and extremism, some countries implement anti-terrorism network governance measures. These examples highlight the diversity of network governance, aiming to balance interests such as freedom of speech, privacy rights, and societal security.</p>
