        <p>There is a computer in the desert, with two thick and long power cords extending from its body. These two cords are pulling it in different directions, stretched tautly. The computer appears to be struggling, yet moving forward at the same time. On the computer screen, there is a deep blue sea，representing the ideal place it wants to conquer</p>
        <p>The Chariot card is the 7th card, and 7 is a number that signifies upward progression and self-transcendence. The method involves learning, facing challenges, and undergoing discipline. In numerology, it's said that individuals with the life path number 7 excel in delving into matters, enjoy the pursuit of truth, are adept at calculations, approach situations rationally, may lack smoothness in dealing with people, are not easily flattered, and won't cherish things that come too easily. They possess analytical talents, enjoy questioning, and seek truth. In the Bible, 7 is considered a perfect number, a divine number.</p>
        <p>The primary significance of the Chariot card is strong willpower. To prevent the chariot one rides in from falling apart, the individual must maintain unwavering confidence and determination, retaining the ability to control the entire situation. Influenced by strong willpower, the warrior cares deeply about victory and possesses strong ambitions, dedicating themselves wholeheartedly to achieving set goals. They have a strong sense of purpose, and even if it requires efforts twice as much as others, they spare no effort, always aiming to be the first. Thus, the Chariot also holds significant meaning in victory.</p>
        <p>A fully equipped chariot represents formidable military strength and a robust barrier. The warrior not only has powerful tools but also a resolute inner will and courage, making them the greatest force to conquer the world. Their strong competitiveness sometimes leads to impulsive actions for the sake of victory. This eagerness for success, however, may harbor hidden dangers and unexpected consequences, but the warrior dismisses such concerns, as success is their sole objective and the driving force propelling them forward.</p>
        <p>The success of the number 7 card is primarily manifested in control at the first level of life. In the Chariot card, it encompasses elements from the preceding 6 cards: the wand held in the hand corresponds to the Magician, the moon and the backdrop drapery correspond to the High Priestess, the stars and the green landscape on the head correspond to the Empress, the armor corresponds to the Emperor, the mysterious symbols on the clothes correspond to the Hierophant, and the black and white sphinxes in the front correspond to the Lovers. Therefore, the success of the Chariot signifies the completion of the major themes of cards 0-7, which revolve around conscious control or willpower. Of course, it also indicates mastery of control over the material world. While the Magician raises the wand, attempting to explore the mysteries of the world, the Chariot represents having already conquered this world—it's just the first level of the material world.</p>
        <p>In cyberspace, the cybersecurity and information warfare conducted between nations and organizations represent a digital occult phenomenon. This encompasses cyber attacks, defense mechanisms, and information strategies, all of which can be seen as the "chariots" of the contemporary digital age.</p>
