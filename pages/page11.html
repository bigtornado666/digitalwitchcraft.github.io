        <p>The image shows that on a dilapidated and awaiting repair Ferris wheel, each compartment is a computer, forming a Ferris wheel made entirely of computers.</p>

        <p>The name "Wheel of Fortune" comes from the Latin names of the three Fates, and this goddess is Vortumna, the mother goddess of Etruscan mythology - Fortuna, meaning "goddess turning the wheel." Similar to the goddess Kali, Fortuna represents the cycles of all time and existence. Her virgin aspect is Fortuna Primigeneia, meaning "bestowing grace upon the body and soul of the faithful." Her motherly aspect is Bona Dea, meaning "good goddess" or "kindly goddess." Her old woman aspect is Mala Fortuna, the goddess of destruction, ultimately taking human lives. The symbol of the Wheel of Fortune worldwide is the wheel of time, derived from the celestial representation of Earth's seasons and cycles - the Milky Way.</p>

        <p>The wheel of destiny turns, and everything around rises and falls with it. The revolving wheel of fate prophesies that all powers are fleeting, and everything is transient. The wheel suggests that everything in the world is constantly changing: sorrow or joy, success or failure, nothing is ever predetermined.</p>
        <p>The wheel of destiny's roulette symbolizes the continuous passing of time. The rotation of the roulette represents cycles, the occurrence of events, and continuous progression. This card accurately depicts the transition and transformative stages within the Major Arcana. As the wheel turns, this card moves from the personality type to the experiential strength, reflecting forces beyond our control. On a simple level, it represents someone having better luck; on a deeper level, it reminds us to focus on inner cultivation.</p>

        <p>In summary, the ceaseless turning of the wheel of destiny signifies the unpredictability of individual fate. Whether you find yourself in the happy world above or the miserable world below when it turns, don't forget your original intentions. As the saying goes, fortunes change like the wind, which is beyond human control. No one knows if the next moment will bring you up or down. Destiny is ever-changing, and each turn is a new cycle, a new beginning, a reincarnation. So when the wheel of destiny predicts adversity, it also implies the arrival of good fortune.</p>
        <p>In puzzle or horror games, it is common for players to be trapped in the same scenario, forced into an endless loop of gameplay. In the indie game "12 Minutes," players assume the role of a husband who encounters an unidentified event, only to realize that he is stuck in a time loop. The story begins with the protagonist returning home to prepare a romantic dinner with his wife. During their conversation and preparations, a man claiming to be a police officer arrives, accusing the wife of involvement in a murder case. The man breaks into their home, attacks the protagonist, and when the protagonist regains consciousness, he finds himself back at the moment he opened the door to come home. Realizing that he is caught in a continuous "12-minute" loop, he is forced to relive various terrifying moments of that night repeatedly. The only way to break the dreadful time loop is to use knowledge of upcoming events to make changes and find a solution.</p>
        <p>In the indie game "Exit 8," players need to start from Exit 0 and keep searching until they find Exit 8; otherwise, they will be trapped in an endless loop at Exit 0. During the search for Exit 8, if the items at the exit shift, the player must backtrack; otherwise, they will be stuck in an infinite loop. Strange occurrences happen during the search, and players must rely on themselves to solve problems, not entirely trusting the NPCs.</p>
        <p>Another once-emerging live streaming model involves the host repeatedly repeating the same segment of dialogue. Alternatively, in the case of sales hosts, they employ a conveyor belt-style presentation of products during the live broadcast, creating a kind of absurd loop.</p>
